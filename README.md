this code is about simulation the relife structure on pygame:
  + To begin, you need to write your point z_coordinated, of if you want to random, you just need to press enter.
  + Second, you can chosse to show the triangle, point, and line of tructure on window_file.
  + Final, this is my first project that I have been write for a time ago, it will have some presentation errors that make the code dirty
    I hove you understand !!!!!!
